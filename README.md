# AppleTreeGame

In this game, the players goal is to catch as many falling apples as possible. The playing character is a boy with a basket of apples who can be controlled
using the left and right arrow keys. Once you press the space bar the game begins and a timer starts to count down from 200 to 0. The player must catch more
apples than they let fall to the groun in this interval. There is a counter on the top of the screen that displays how many apples have been caught and how
many have been dropped. Once the timer reaches 0, the game stops running and a screen shows either "you win" or "you lose" depending on how many apples
the player has caught.
